# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is version control software used to track the state of files associated with a project. Users can take snapshots of files, travel through the history of a project, collaborate transparently with others, and easily keep compatible data in many locations. Combined with GitHub, a cloud service, Git also becomes a way of finding and publishing text, including writing and code.

In this session, we'll Learn what makes Git such a powerful tool for both collaborative and individual projects. We will share a conceptual overview of Git and GitHub, teach the basics of how to get started, and explore practical applications of GitHub for writing and coding. This workshop will be applicable for a wide range of digital undertakings, from developing code, to working with datasets, to drafting public policy, and beyond.

By the end of this session, you will:
- Have a basic understanding of how Git and GitHub are used by scholars for version control and collaboration 
- Create a Git repository on your computer, add files, and push this repository to your GitHub account
- Clone a repository created by another scholar, modify the files to reflect your interests, and the push the updated repository to your GitHub account
