# Collaboration and Tracking Workflows with Git and GitHub

Git is version control software used to track the state of files associated with a project. Users can take snapshots of files, travel through the history of a project, collaborate transparently with others, and easily keep compatible data in many locations. Combined with GitHub, a cloud service, Git also becomes a way of finding and publishing text, including writing and code.

In this session, we'll Learn what makes Git such a powerful tool for both collaborative and individual projects. We will share a conceptual overview of Git and GitHub, teach the basics of how to get started, and explore practical applications of GitHub for writing and coding. This workshop will be applicable for a wide range of digital undertakings, from developing code, to working with datasets, to drafting public policy, and beyond.

In this session, we'll Create a Git repository on your computer, add files, and push this repository to your GitHub account.

This session by Patrick Sweeney is based on the Git Workshop offered at the GC Digital Research Institute in January 2018, forked from the GCDRI January 2017 workshop led by Jojo Karlin, which was forked from the GCDRI June 2016 git workshop taught by Jennifer Tang and Stephen Zweibel. Thanks to Mary Catherine McKinniburgh for developing an earlier version of this session.
