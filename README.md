# Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git is version control software used to track the state of files associated with a project. Users can take snapshots of files, travel through the history of a project, collaborate transparently with others, and easily keep compatible data in many locations. Combined with GitHub, a cloud service, Git also becomes a way of finding and publishing text, including writing and code.

In this session, we'll Learn what makes Git such a powerful tool for both collaborative and individual projects. We will share a conceptual overview of Git and GitHub, teach the basics of how to get started, and explore practical applications of GitHub for writing and coding. This workshop will be applicable for a wide range of digital undertakings, from developing code, to working with datasets, to drafting public policy, and beyond.

Session Leader: Patrick Sweeney  
Based on sessions by Jojo Karlin, Jennifer Tang, Stephen Zweibel, and Mary Catherine McKinniburgh
