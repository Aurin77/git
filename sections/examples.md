# What You Can Do with Git and GitHub

A [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:
- developing software
- sharing datasets
- creating websites
- writing projects, such as articles or books
- collections of online resources
- research notes
- syllabi and course materials

## Why Use GitHub?  
  
Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated: 
- sharing and backing up files on multiple computers
- monitoring changes effectively
- recover from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose
- use different branches for experiments and new directions
- share and manage files with others, seeing who added what content and when

## How We Use GitHub:

### Sharing and Attribution
As you can see across the workshops this week, at GCDI we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting the sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing, as well as facilitating attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, and when it was added. 
#### Case 1: This Workshop!
If you look just under the workshop title at the top of this page, you can see it is "forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018." That shows that this particular repository is building on ("forked from") the curriculum for a session I presented at our January 2018 Institute. If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. 

### Collaborative Writing
Some of us use Git to track changes (*version control* in Git parlance) in writing projects, and find it to be a cleaner, more elegant solution than the tracked changes function in a Microsoft Word document. 
##### Case 2: Co-authored Publications
I personally have had Word crash, and sections of an article lost, when collaborating on a large writing project with co-authors who were using different versions of Word! If we had tracked our revisions using Git, the previous versions of the paper are always saved and changes documented in case we wanted to return to an idea from an earlier draft, or a section that reviewer 3 *really* wants to see in included in the discussion but was originally cut for space. 

### How You Could Use GitHub

Have you ever had a folder full of multiple and conflictiong versions of documents that looked like this? 
syllabus.doc syllabus2.doc syllabusnew.doc syllabusRevised.doc syllabusFINAL.doc syllabus?.doc 

Many of us, especially if it's a new prep, borrow and adapt from syllabi that colleagues have shared with us. For example, when I first taught, I was offered syllabi by colleagues who had taught the course before. I utilized some of their work as a base to build my particular course, and after developing my own syllabi I happily emailed them to other graduate students teaching for the first time. This common and collegial practice has some challenges, however. As my colleagues and I emailed around Word documents, it became difficult to identify who had created which assignments or language, and we rarely got to see how others developed innovative approaches that would be useful in our own classes. 

#### Case 3: Syllabi
If my colleagues and I had instead forked our syllabi from eachother's repositories on GitHub, our individual work would be attributed, and we could follow eachother's revisions and additions to better revise our own. I could also easily go back to syllabi from previous semesters and dig up that classic or obscure reading that I wanted to reincorporate into the course.

Later in this workshop, you will fork an example syllabus I created, modify it to match your interests, and then push it back to GitHub. This exercise will show illustrate basic functions of Git and GitHub as well as demonstrating how collaboration and version control can be useful in scholarly applications such as course syllabi.
