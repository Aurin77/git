# What You Can Do with Git and GitHub

A [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:
- developing software
- sharing datasets
- creating websites
- writing projects, such as articles or books
- collections of online resources
- research notes
- syllabi and course materials
