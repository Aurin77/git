# What You Can Do with Git and GitHub

A [study of how Digital Humanists use GitHub](https://digitalscholarship.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/spirosmithdh2016githubpresentationfinal.pdf), conducted by Lisa Spiro and Sean Morey Smith, found that a wide range of users, including professors, research staff, graduate students, IT staff, and librarians commonly used the site in their DH work. They used GitHub for a diverse range of activities, such as:
- developing software
- sharing datasets
- creating websites
- writing projects, such as articles or books
- collections of online resources
- research notes
- syllabi and course materials

## Why Use GitHub?  
  
Participants in the study said they found GitHub useful in their Digital Humanities work for several reasons. In particular, it facilitated: 
- sharing and backing up files on multiple computers
- monitoring changes effectively
- recover from bugs or errors by going back in time before the error arose
- use different branches for experiments and new directions
- share and manage files with others, seeing who added what content and when

## How We Use GitHub:

### Sharing and Attribution
As you can see across the workshops this week, here at GCDI we use GitHub to host workshop curricula. Hosting the sessions on GitHub allows you (and anyone else interested in these topics!) to follow our repositories, and create your own version of the workshop based on our materials. This fosters open scholarship and knowledge sharing, as well as facilitating attribution and citation by clearly tracking which content was created by whom, and when it was added. If you look just under the workshop title at the top of this page, you can see it is "forked from pswee001/Git_DRI_Jan_2018." That shows that this particular repository is building on ("forked from") the curriculum for a session I presented at our January 2018 Institute. If you then look at that repository, you will see that it is in turn forked from previous sessions that were developed by other GC Digital Fellows for workshops in past years. 

### Collaborative Writing
Some of us use Git to track changes (*version control* in Git parlance) in writing projects, and find it to be a cleaner, more elegant solution than the tracked changes fucntion in a Microsoft Word document. I personally have had Word crash, and sections of an article lost, when collaborating on a large writing project with co-authors who were using different versions of Word! If we had tracked our revisions using Git, the previous versions of the paper are always saved and changes documented in case we wanted to return to an idea from an earlier draft, or a section that reviewer 3 *really* wants to see in included in the discussion but was originally cut for space.
