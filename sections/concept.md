# What are Git, GitHub and Markdown?

## What is Git? 

**Git** is a version control tool. It lives on your computer (is local), and is accessed through the command line.

Git tracks changes when the user tells it to `git add` a file, and `git commit` logs the different versions you see here. When you `git add` and `git commit`, all these files live in the `.git` repository on your computer.

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud service for hosting Git repositories. It's also a place to find the code or writing of others.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language for formatting text. Unlike HTML, markdown is designed to be human-readable, which makes it much easier to write and edit.

You can think of markdown as a language read by many platforms and sites, including GitHub, to style text. Since markdown is plain text, it's also arguably more sustainable and accessible than formats like .docx. . You'll notice this file is in markdown--check out its extension!
