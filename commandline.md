# Review of the command line

In contrast to a GUI, or graphical user interface, the command line lets us tell our computer exactly what we want it to do using successive lines of text. 

The commmand line is one of the primary ways of using Git on your computer. We're going to use this method practice what we learned yesterday, and help us grasp the concepts of Git (and feel like we have computational superpowers, making files appear out of thin air). To review...

## Accessing the Terminal

### Mac OS

Press the space bar and the command key at the same time and type `terminal`.

### Windows

Press the Windows button on your keyboard. When the search menu pops up, type `cmd` and press `Enter`.

## Practice Navigating the Command Line

In this session, we will be making a syllabus and using Git to keep track of our revisions. Let's create a Git project folder

`cd <directory-name>` will let you navigate inside a directory of your choosing.

Type `cd Desktop` and hit enter.

Now, `cd ..` lets you go up a directory.

Practice going back and forth between your Desktop and your home directory. Experiment! The more you type the more natural the command line will feel.

Got lost? `pwd` or "print working directory" will tell you where you are if you get a little lost.

When finished, go to your Desktop folder and check that you're there with `pwd`.

### Making a Git Project Folder

From your Desktop, navigate into your `projects` folder. Then create a `git` folder with the below command:

	mkdir git

Use your GUI to confirm that you have a `git` folder inside your `projects` folder on the desktop. Your folder structure should look like this:

	/home/<username>/Desktop/projects/git
